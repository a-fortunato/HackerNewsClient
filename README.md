# Hacker News Client

Small Hacker News Client done in React Native for a job interview.

Task:
* User should be able to list best stories on Hacker News.
* User should be able to open the actual story.
* User should be able to read the comments related to individual stories.

Currently the solution is incomplete.
It shows Hacker News best stories (and it's possible to read each story), but to access the comments if each it loads Hacker New's page in a WebView. A better solution would have the comments fetched and showed in the app.

To try the project out:
 * Install with `yarn`
 * Run with `yarn expo start`

 It can be tried on a physical device scanning the QR code or on a simulator/emulator.
